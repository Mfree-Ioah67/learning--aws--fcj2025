## Program Overview

I completed the **AWS First Cloud Journey Program** over a **12-week period** from September to December 2025. This comprehensive program was structured in three distinct phases:

### Phase 1: AWS Fundamentals (Weeks 1-7)
The first seven weeks focused on building a solid foundation in AWS cloud services. I systematically learned core AWS services through hands-on labs, covering compute, storage, networking, databases, security, and analytics. Each week included practical exercises to reinforce theoretical knowledge.

### Phase 2: Project Proposal (Week 8)
Week 8 was dedicated to developing a comprehensive project proposal for the **Blood Donation Support System**. This involved designing AWS architecture, selecting appropriate services, estimating costs, and creating an implementation timeline.

### Phase 3: Project Implementation (Weeks 9-12)
The final four weeks involved building and deploying the complete application on AWS, including infrastructure setup, backend development with Spring Boot, frontend development with React+Vite, and implementing CI/CD automation.
