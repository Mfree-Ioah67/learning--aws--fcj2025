During my participation in the **First Cloud Journey Program** from **September 2025** to **December 2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply AWS cloud computing knowledge through structured learning and hands-on project work.

Throughout the program, I completed **12 weeks of progressive learning and development**, including **7 weeks of AWS fundamentals training**, **1 week of project proposal development**, and **4 weeks of hands-on project implementation**. Additionally, I translated **3 AWS technical blogs** and attended **5 AWS community events**. These activities helped me develop skills in **AWS cloud services, system architecture design, full-stack development, CI/CD automation, and technical documentation**.

In terms of work ethic, I maintained consistent weekly progress, actively participated in AWS community events, and completed both the learning modules and project implementation on schedule.

To objectively reflect on my program participation, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:

### Strengths

* **Consistent learning commitment**: Successfully completed 7 weeks of AWS fundamentals training covering EC2, S3, RDS, VPC, IAM, Lambda, and other core services with hands-on labs
* **Project completion**: Designed and implemented Blood Donation Support System from proposal through deployment, including AWS architecture design, cost estimation (~$8.90/month), and full-stack development
* **Technical implementation**: Built complete application with React+Vite frontend on S3/CloudFront, Spring Boot backend on EC2, MySQL on RDS, and automated CI/CD pipeline with CodePipeline
* **Active community engagement**: Attended 5 AWS events covering AI/ML, DevOps, Security, and Well-Architected Framework, demonstrating commitment to continuous learning beyond coursework
* **Documentation skills**: Translated 3 technical AWS blogs on PrivateLink, Verified Access, and cloud networking, improving both technical understanding and Vietnamese technical writing
* **Time management**: Maintained weekly progress throughout 12 weeks, completing all deliverables on schedule

### Needs Improvement

* **Depth of AWS knowledge**: While I covered many services, my understanding remains at beginner level (C01-C03). Need more hands-on experience with advanced features and production scenarios
* **Problem-solving independence**: Often followed tutorials and guides closely. Should develop stronger ability to troubleshoot issues independently and design solutions from scratch
* **Communication skills**: Technical presentations and documentation could be more concise and professional. Need practice explaining complex concepts clearly
* **Proactive learning**: Tended to focus on assigned tasks. Should explore more AWS services independently and experiment with different architectural patterns
* **Team collaboration**: Limited experience working in team settings during the program. Need more practice with code reviews, pair programming, and collaborative development
* **Production readiness**: Project implementation focused on core functionality. Should learn more about production concerns like monitoring, logging, security hardening, and disaster recovery
