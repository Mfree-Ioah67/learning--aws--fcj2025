> Here, I share my personal experience participating in the First Cloud Journey program. This feedback aims to help the FCJ team understand what worked well and what could be improved for future participants.

### Overall Evaluation

**1. Program Structure & Content**  
The program structure was well-organized with clear weekly objectives. The progression from AWS fundamentals (Weeks 1-7) to project proposal (Week 8) and implementation (Weeks 9-12) made sense and allowed for gradual skill building. The hands-on labs were particularly valuable for understanding AWS services beyond just theory. However, the pace was quite fast, especially in the early weeks when learning multiple new services simultaneously.

**2. Learning Resources & Documentation**  
The provided learning materials, including AWS documentation links, workshop guides, and reference architectures, were comprehensive and helpful. The AWS Study Group resources (awsstudygroup.com) were particularly useful for Vietnamese learners. However, I sometimes found it challenging to know which resources to prioritize when there were many links provided for each topic.

**3. Community Events**  
Attending 5 AWS community events was one of the highlights of the program. The events provided valuable insights from industry professionals and alumni, which helped me understand real-world applications of AWS services. The networking opportunities were excellent, and hearing success stories from previous participants was very motivating. I especially appreciated the diverse topics covered: AI/ML, DevOps, Security, and Well-Architected Framework.

**4. Project-Based Learning**  
The Blood Donation Support System project was a great way to apply learned concepts. Designing the AWS architecture, estimating costs, and implementing the full-stack application gave me practical experience that labs alone couldn't provide. However, I felt I could have benefited from more guidance during the implementation phase, particularly around best practices for production deployment and security hardening.

**5. Blog Translation Activity**  
Translating 3 AWS technical blogs was more valuable than I initially expected. It forced me to deeply understand the technical concepts to translate them accurately into Vietnamese. This activity improved both my technical knowledge and my ability to communicate complex ideas. However, the blogs were quite advanced (PrivateLink, Verified Access), which was challenging given my beginner level.

**6. Support & Mentorship**  
The program provided good documentation and resources for self-learning. The weekly structure helped maintain momentum and accountability. However, I would have appreciated more opportunities for direct mentorship or Q&A sessions when encountering technical challenges during project implementation.

### What I Found Most Satisfying

- **Completing a full project lifecycle**: From proposal to deployment, seeing the Blood Donation Support System come to life was incredibly rewarding
- **Community connections**: Meeting AWS professionals and fellow learners at events expanded my network and perspective
- **Hands-on AWS experience**: Actually deploying services on AWS (EC2, RDS, S3, CloudFront, CodePipeline) rather than just reading about them
- **Structured learning path**: The 12-week progression provided clear direction and measurable progress

### Areas for Improvement

**For the Program:**
- **More intermediate guidance**: The jump from basic labs to full project implementation felt steep. Some intermediate exercises or mini-projects could help bridge this gap
- **Peer collaboration opportunities**: The program felt quite individual. More structured team projects or peer review sessions could enhance learning
- **Technical support channels**: A dedicated Slack/Discord channel or regular office hours for technical questions would be helpful
- **Production best practices**: More emphasis on monitoring, logging, security, and cost optimization in production environments

**For Future Participants:**
- Start the project planning earlier (don't wait until Week 8)
- Join the AWS Study Group community actively from the beginning
- Take notes during events and connect with speakers on LinkedIn
- Don't hesitate to ask questions when stuck - struggling alone wastes time

### Would I Recommend This Program?

**Yes, I would recommend it**, especially for students who:
- Want to gain practical AWS experience beyond certifications
- Are self-motivated and comfortable with independent learning
- Have basic programming knowledge (frontend/backend)
- Are interested in cloud computing careers

However, I would advise them to:
- Be prepared for a fast pace and significant time commitment
- Have some prior exposure to web development (React, Spring Boot, or similar)
- Plan to dedicate time beyond just following the weekly tasks
- Actively participate in community events for maximum benefit

### Suggestions & Expectations

**Suggestions to Improve the Program:**

1. **Add a mid-program checkpoint**: A Week 6 review session to assess progress and address common challenges before starting the project phase

2. **Create a mentorship pairing system**: Connect new participants with alumni who can provide guidance and answer questions

3. **Introduce peer code reviews**: Have participants review each other's work (architecture designs, code) to learn different approaches

4. **Provide project templates**: Starter templates for common architectures (3-tier web app, serverless API, etc.) to help participants focus on AWS services rather than basic setup

5. **Add cost monitoring emphasis**: More focus on AWS cost management throughout the program, not just in the proposal phase

6. **Create a showcase event**: An end-of-program demo day where participants present their projects to each other and industry guests

**Would I Continue This Program?**

Yes, I would be interested in an advanced track that covers:
- AWS certifications preparation (Solutions Architect Associate/Professional)
- Advanced topics like EKS, serverless architectures, data analytics
- Production operations: monitoring, incident response, cost optimization
- Multi-account strategies and AWS Organizations

**Additional Comments:**

The First Cloud Journey program provided a solid foundation in AWS cloud computing and gave me confidence to pursue cloud-related career opportunities. While challenging at times, the structured approach and practical project work made the learning experience valuable and applicable to real-world scenarios.

The program's greatest strength is its comprehensive approach - combining technical learning, community engagement, and hands-on project work. This multi-faceted experience is more valuable than just completing online courses or certifications alone.

I'm grateful for the opportunity to participate and look forward to applying these skills in my future career. Thank you to the FCJ team and the AWS community for creating and supporting this program.
